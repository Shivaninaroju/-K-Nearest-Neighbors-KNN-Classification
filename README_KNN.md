# 🔍 K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classification — Internship Task

## 📌 Overview
This project demonstrates **KNN classification** on the Iris dataset.  
It includes preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization.  

## ✅ Objectives
- Normalize dataset with StandardScaler  
- Train KNN classifier with k=5  
- Evaluate with confusion matrix & classification report  
- Compare accuracy across multiple K values  
- Visualize decision boundaries in 2D  

## 📊 Dataset
We use the **Iris dataset** from `sklearn.datasets`.  

## 🧪 Results
- KNN model trained with k=5  
- Confusion matrix heatmap generated  
- Accuracy vs K graph plotted  
- Decision boundaries visualized in 2D projection  

## ⚙️ Requirements
- Python 3.10+  
- pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn
